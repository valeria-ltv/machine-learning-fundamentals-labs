# Classification Metrics and Threshold Analysis

## Task:

### 1) Open and read data from the provided file. 

### 2) Determine the balance of the data set. Output the number of objects of each class.

### 3) Perform the following actions:
#### a. Calculate all metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Scores, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Balanced Accuracy) for each model at different values ​​of the classifier threshold.
#### b. Plot on one graph in one coordinate system (threshold value; metric value) graphs of all calculated metrics, marking in a certain way the maximum value of each of them.
#### c. Plot separate graphs of the number of objects for each class in coordinates (classifier score values; number of objects in each class) and mark the optimal cutoff thresholds for each metric with vertical lines. 
#### d. Plot a PR curve and ROC curve for each classifier.

### 4) Draw conclusions about the quality of the models, determine the best model.

### 5) Create a new data set by removing (50 + 10K)% of class 1 objects, selected randomly, from the initial set.

### 6) Output the percentage of class 1 objects removed and the number of elements of each class after removal.

### 7) Perform the steps in point 3 for the new data set.
