# k-Nearest Neighbors Classification

## Task:

### 1) Read data from the given file. 

### 2) Determine and display the number of records and display the attributes of the dataset.

### 3) Get ten options for shuffling the data set and splitting it into training and test sets using the ShuffleSplit function. Generate the initial and test sets based on the eighth option. Find out if the data set is balanced.

### 4) Using the KNeighborsClassifier function of the scikit-learn library, build a classification model based on the k-nearest neighbors method (leave all parameter values ​​at default) and train it on the training set.

### 5) Calculate the classification metrics of the built model for the training and test sets. Present the results of the model on the test set graphically.

### 6) Find out the effect of the number of neighbors (from 1 to 20) on the classification results. Present the results graphically.
