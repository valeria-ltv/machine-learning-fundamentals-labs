## Labs Overview

### Lab 1 — Classification Metrics and Threshold Analysis
Evaluation of classifiers using multiple metrics, ROC/PR curves, and the effect of threshold values.

### Lab 2 — Decision Tree Classifier
Training, visualization, and evaluation of decision trees with different splitting criteria and parameter tuning.

### Lab 3 — k-Nearest Neighbors Classification
Application of the k-NN method, dataset splitting with ShuffleSplit, and analysis of the effect of the number of neighbors.

### Lab 4 — Clustering with k-Means and Hierarchical Methods
Exploring unsupervised learning with k-Means (random and k-means++ initialization), cluster number selection, and Agglomerative Clustering.
